This was a project requested at the university in the Network Security discipline, which consists of creating symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.
Considering my little experience in javascript, css and html, it has been a very challenging project.
I know perfectly well that there is a lot to improve and if you have any tips for me, leave me a message.
The project is far from finished, it is under constant construction.

thanks
